## Short Description:
It is a modified form of tic-tac-toe where players can move their pieces. The objective of this game is to arrange the pieces linearly. Each player has 3 pieces to fill and move those pieces in order to achieve the objective. 

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- tkinter (Python GUI library)

## Dependencies
 Install tkinter by executing the following commands in the terminal.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Instructions:
* Run main.py with python3 and the game will be started with a pop-up containing some instructions.
* Single click will allow the filling of the pieces in the empty locations.
* When all the pieces (total 6) are filled, then players can move their pieces with the help of double-click.

## Further Enhancements:
* As of now, two players (only humans) can play with each other. However, Artificial Intelligence can be implemented so that a human player can play against the program.
